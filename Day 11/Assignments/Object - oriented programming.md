## C# - What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

-   OOP is faster and easier to execute
-   OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
-   OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
-   OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods. In the context of C#, OOP is foundational, and it includes several key concepts, benefits, and drawbacks.

### Main Concepts of OOP in C#

1.  **Encapsulation**:
    
    -   Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
    -   Protects the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.
    -   Access modifiers (public, private, protected) control visibility.
Example: 
  

    public class BankAccount
    {
        private decimal balance;
        public void Deposit(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount > 0)
            {
                balance += amount;
            }
        }
       public decimal GetBalance()
        {
            return balance;
        }
    }

2.  **Inheritance**:
    
    -   A mechanism to create a new class (derived class) based on an existing class (base class).
    -   Promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship.
    -   Can lead to polymorphism, allowing methods to be overridden.
Example:

    public class Animal
    {
        public virtual void Speak()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks");
        }
    }
    
    public class Dog : Animal
    {
        public override void Speak()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Woof");
        }
    }

3.  **Polymorphism**:
    
    -   The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
    -   Achieved through method overriding and interface implementation.
    -   Enhances flexibility and the ability to write more generic code.
Example:

    public class Cat : Animal
    {
        public override void Speak()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Meow");
        }
    }
    
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Animal myDog = new Dog();
            Animal myCat = new Cat();
    
            myDog.Speak(); // Outputs: Woof
            myCat.Speak(); // Outputs: Meow
        }
    }


4.  **Abstraction**:
    
    -   The concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.
    -   Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, allowing for a simplified view of an object.
Example:

  

      public abstract class Shape
        {
            public abstract double Area();
        }
        
        public class Circle : Shape
        {
            private double radius;
        
            public Circle(double radius)
            {
                this.radius = radius;
            }
        
            public override double Area()
            {
                return Math.PI * radius * radius;
            }
        }

 



### Benefits of OOP in C#

1.  **Modularity**:
    
    -   OOP allows breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces (classes), making development and maintenance easier.
2.  **Reusability**:
    
    -   Through inheritance and polymorphism, existing classes can be reused, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
3.  **Maintainability**:
    
    -   Code changes can be made easily since classes can be modified independently, facilitating easier updates and bug fixes.
4.  **Scalability**:
    
    -   OOP designs can be easily expanded, allowing applications to grow without significant rewrites.
5.  **Clear Structure**:
    
    -   Encourages a clear organization of code, which enhances readability and understandability.

### Drawbacks of OOP in C#

1.  **Complexity**:
    
    -   The initial setup of an OOP system can be more complex than procedural programming, requiring a deeper understanding of OOP principles.
2.  **Performance Overhead**:
    
    -   The abstraction layers and additional features (like dynamic dispatch) can introduce performance overhead, which might be a concern in performance-critical applications.
3.  **Learning Curve**:
    
    -   For beginners, grasping OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism can be challenging, potentially slowing down the initial learning process.
4.  **Over-Engineering**:
    
    -   There is a risk of over-complicating designs by implementing unnecessary classes and relationships, leading to bloated codebases.
5.  **Tight Coupling**:
    
    -   If not managed well, classes can become tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify one without affecting others.
